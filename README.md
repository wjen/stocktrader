- Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
-	Enter your email address and a password, and click “Create account”.
- On the next page, scroll down to choose the Start (free) plan.
- Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to iexcloud.io.
- Click API Tokens.
- Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
In a terminal window execute:
```
$ export API_KEY=value
```
where value is that (pasted) value, without any space immediately before or after the =.
